Althought this project is fully working there are some things left to do.

1. Find a solution to get rid of the sliders, huge dependency
2. Add a form to let user associate/unassociate different media types.
3. Figure out how to improve the sound.
4. Optimize and clean up the code
5. Improve the look and feel of the GUI
